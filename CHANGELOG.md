# 0.2.0

- Mobile UI support
- Sponsorblock support
- Increase video player control buttons size
- Various UI fixes
- Refactor internal resource fetching
- Refactor `RustyTubeError`

Notes:

I will be taking a break from this project as it is very time-consuming (~1000 hours currently). If you want a new feature added, submit a pull request and I will review it.

- There will be no Linux release for this update as the UI changes do not work on webkit2gtk. Until Tauri stops using webkit2gtk for Linux, use RustyTube in your preferred browser.
- Partial playlist support exists, but it is too time consuming to finish. If you really want playlists, it should not be too difficult to add.

# 0.1.1

- Fix empty searching

# 0.1.0
